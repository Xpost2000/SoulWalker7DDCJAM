# Soul Walker

This game was made for the Dungeon Crawler Game Jam that lasted a week.

While I'm surprised at how fast I was able to pickup Unity to produce
something functional.

Perhaps trying to do participate in a gamejam in the middle of midterm
season as a full time student was a serious mistake...

Regardless for something that effectively used only 3 or 4 of the 7 days
and using about two weekends to try and learn Unity as preparation I think
I did well enough...

The game is completable from start to finish although it sacrificed a lot
more than I would've personally liked.

This game is the spiritual successor of DarkDescent, which was used to
learn MonoGame, and is incomplete.

This game is basically what DarkDescent was supposed to be.
